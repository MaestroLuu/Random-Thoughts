# Random-Thoughts

## Description

This application is a model of a social network API where users can create new thoughts and react to other users' thoughts in return. This application is entirely back-end functionality and as such, clients will need to utilize insomnia or postman that allows them to test this API.

## Installation

In order for the application to function properly, users must have either Insomnia, Postman, or any other 3rd framework that allows tesing of RESTful APIs. Users can install the Insomnia application by going to the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) web page and downloading from the links there. Otherwise, users can also utilize [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for free on their web browser without the need to directly download the application. They will need to create a free account in order to access these features. 

## Usage

To use this application, users will need to install the package.json in their terminal, Afterwards, they can opt to utilize the seed script by running "npm run seed" or if they would prefer to create their own data, users can use the routes in insomnia/postman. However, they will need to review the models, routes, and controllers for utility of this application. Once completed, they can enter 'npm start' in their terminal and the application will listen to requests on "localhost:3001". Users can review the appropriate routes within the 'routes' directory and select which route they would like to preview.
